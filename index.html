<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We host weekly service and fellowship events that give our members the opportunity to make a consistent impact both on campus and in the Gainesville community. Our chapter partners with a variety of local non-profits to support causes such as sustainability, education, and community wellness. Some of our regular partners include the Repurpose Project, North Florida Sewing Center, and the Giving Garden, where we assist with everything from organizing donations to hands-on volunteer work.</p>
<p>On campus, we are best known for operating the Information Booth near Turlington Hall, a long-standing tradition that allows us to help fellow students navigate UF’s campus and share important university updates. In addition to our weekly service, we also participate in special projects with organizations like the Lubee Bat Conservancy, Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary, and other unique animal sanctuaries, allowing members to engage in hands-on conservation and animal care efforts.</p>
<p>Through these diverse opportunities, our members develop leadership skills, build lasting friendships, and contribute meaningfully to our community while living out the values of Alpha Phi Omega: Leadership, Friendship, and Service.</p>

<h2>Our Values: Leadership, Friendship, and Service</h2>
<p><span class="highlight-yellow">Leadership</span></p>
<p>We believe that everyone has the potential to lead. Whether you're stepping into a formal role or taking initiative behind the scenes, APO provides countless opportunities to develop leadership skills that make a lasting impact. From organizing service events and running meetings to mentoring Pledges and leading committees, our chapter empowers members to grow into confident, capable leaders, on campus and beyond. Many of our Brothers also represent APO at regional and national conferences, gaining even broader leadership exposure.</p>
<p><span class="highlight-yellow">Service</span></p>
<p>Our Brotherhood is built on strong, meaningful connections. Friendship in APO goes beyond just hanging out, it's about supporting each other through service, celebrating milestones, and building a community that feels like home. Through weekly fellowship events, retreats, and shared experiences, we form lasting bonds that extend far beyond our time at UF. Our inclusive and co-ed environment creates space for people from all walks of life to find belonging.</p>
<p>Service</p>
<p>Service is the heart of our mission. We are committed to making a positive difference in our campus, community, and nation. Our chapter hosts weekly service projects and collaborates with local organizations such as the Repurpose Project, Giving Garden, North Florida Sewing Center, Ronald McDonald House, GRACE Marketplace, Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary, and more. Whether we’re planting gardens, serving meals, or supporting animal sanctuaries, we show up with purpose and compassion.</p>
<p>Together, Leadership, Friendship, and Service define what it means to be a Brother of Alpha Phi Omega. They guide our actions, unite our members, and inspire us to create meaningful change, every day.</p>
